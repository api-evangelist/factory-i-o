      The web server in Factory I/O uses conventional HTTP response codes to
      indicate the success or failure of a request. In general, codes in the 2xx
      range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate a problem with the
      request, and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error in Factory I/O.

  FACTORY I/O is a software simulation tool that allows users to create and
  simulate industrial automation systems in a virtual environment. It provides a
  realistic and interactive platform for training, testing, and troubleshooting
  automation processes without the need for physical equipment. Users can design
  their own control systems, program PLCs, and observe the behavior of machines
  and processes in real-time. FACTORY I/O is widely used in educational
  institutions, training centers, and manufacturing industries to improve the
  efficiency and safety of automation systems.
